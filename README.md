## üìç Overview

The project is a web application that allows users to take a coffee break and read articles from selected categories. Thanks to the french website [journalduhacker.net](https://journalduhacker.net/), the application fetches the latest articles sorted by category from the RSS feed and displays a random article title with a link. The application is developed with PHP and Docker, allowing it to run on any platform with Docker installed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature                | Description                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**     | The codebase follows a simple Apache PHP server architecture. The Dockerfile sets up an Apache server running PHP 8.0, with code in the 'src' directory accessible as the document root. |
| **üìñ Documentation**   | No specific mention of documentation in the repository, limiting its evaluation.                            |
| **üîó Dependencies**    | The codebase appears to have no external dependencies apart from the base Docker images for Apache and PHP. |
| **üß© Modularity**      | The system's organization consists of multiple files with clear responsibilities. The main code resides in 'index.php', and the CSS files are modularity separated for different concerns. |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Testing**          | No information about testing strategies or tools, suggesting a lack of formalized testing in the codebase. |
| **‚ö°Ô∏è Performance**      | The system's performance mainly depends on the capabilities of the Apache server and the code optimization within 'index.php'. A full performance analysis cannot be done without further profiling. |
| **üîÄ Version Control** | The codebase uses Git for version control, allowing collaboration, code history tracking, and ease of deployment to production or other environments. |
